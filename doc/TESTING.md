## Custom Markdown Wiki Page Links

### Link Format
```
(Display Text)[userid/pageid]
```

Example:
```markdown
Check out (Alice's Page)[alice_user_id/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000]
```

### Usage
- After authentication, click "Open Wiki" button to access the wiki
- Links automatically navigate between pages in the same view
- Links are intercepted and handled internally (won't open in browser)

### Page Storage
- Currently: In-memory `PageStore` with test pages (home, Alice, Bob)
- Future: Ready to swap with pubky link-based storage
- Page format: `HashMap<String, String>` mapping page IDs to markdown content

### Logging
Run with `RUST_LOG=info cargo run` to see:
- Link clicks: `ðŸ”— Intercepted link click: <url>`
- Navigation: `ðŸ“„ Navigating to: <url>`
- Page transitions: `Navigate to page: <from> -> <to>`
