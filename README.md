# Pubky Decentralized Wiki

A decentralized wiki application built on the Pubky protocol, enabling users to create, edit, and share wiki pages in a truly decentralized manner.

## Description

Pubky Wiki is a desktop application that leverages the Pubky decentralized protocol to provide a censorship-resistant, user-owned wiki platform. Built with Rust and egui, it offers a native GUI experience for creating and managing wiki content that is stored on your own Pubky homeserver. Users authenticate via QR code scanning with the Pubky Ring app, ensuring secure and decentralized identity management.

Key features:
- **Decentralized Storage**: Wiki pages are stored on the Pubky network, not on centralized servers
- **User Ownership**: You control your content through your Pubky identity
- **Fork & Share**: Discover and fork wiki pages from people you follow
- **Native Experience**: Clean desktop interface built with egui
- **Markdown Support**: Write wiki pages in Markdown with live preview

- **Censorship-Resistant Publishing**: Publish information that can't be taken down by centralized authorities
- **Decentralized Education**: Create and share educational content that remains accessible and unmodifiable
- **Community Wikis**: Build topic-specific wikis with contributors across the decentralized network
